        The Tokyo network will be upgraded to provide network enhancements as
        part of ongoing efforts to provide excellent service and maintain an
        ideal hosting environment. A device reload may be necessary and some
        customers may experience brief periods of latency or packetloss while
        routes are updated across the redundant topology.
